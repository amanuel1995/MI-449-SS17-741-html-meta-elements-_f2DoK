    <p class="note">If you're ready to express your geekiness without saying one word, it's time for one of our t-shirts. They're funny and snarky, plus they contain 100% of your recommended daily allowance of obscure Star Wars references. Or math. Or science. Or gaming. Basically if you're smart, we have a tee that'll make you laugh. And your friends, too. And random people in the grocery store who will stop you and ask you where you got your shirt. So brace yourself.</p>
    <h5>GO AWAY</h5>

    <article>Geeks: we're one big group of loners. Most of us are not much good at the whole social interaction thing. In fact, we've trained our whole lives to be Not Good at it. From playing house alone to petitioning to be the project manager, technical lead, designer, and tester all in one on your next project, you know that other people just make life more complicated. But don't worry. You're in good company here. You're amongst people who understand, cause we're like that, too. For most of us, if it starts with "social," it better end with "networking sites."</article>

    <article>Pretty much whenever we're out in public, geeks take a circumstance penalty to our CHA-based skills (except Handle Animal), and if you want to land some sort of bonus to offset that, you'd have to down a lot of alcohol or wear a shirt that forewarns people of the situation in a humorous manner and automatically breaks the ice with no effort whatsoever on your part. Oh wait. That's what this is! How convenient is that?</article>

    <article>This is a 100% cotton charcoal grey t-shirt with the declaration "You read my t-shirt. That's enough social interaction for one day." printed in white upon it.</article>
